    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Private Heap Space**: Python memory management is centered around a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The allocation of this heap is managed by the Python memory manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reference Counting**: Python internally keeps track of the number of references to an object in the system. When an objectâ€™s reference count drops to zero, Python automatically reclaims the memory it occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Garbage Collection**: Python uses a garbage collector that periodically searches for groups of objects that are only accessible by each other, and therefore can be safely deleted. The garbage collector is based on the \"generation\" concept, where objects are categorized based on their longevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Pools**: Python employs a system of memory pools for managing small blocks of memory. When a Python object is destroyed, its memory block isn't immediately returned to the OS but is kept in a pool to be reused by future objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Python's memory management system is designed to abstract away most concerns of memory allocation and deallocation from the developer, allowing for ease of programming."

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "In Python, if an object is hashable, it means that it has a hash value that does not change during its entire lifetime (it needs a `__hash__()` method), and it can be compared to other objects (it needs an `__eq__()` or `__cmp__()` method). Hashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set member because these data structures use the hash value internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of Python's immutable built-in objects are hashable; mutable containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are not hashable, while immutable containers (like tuples and frozensets) are hashable if all their elements are hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some points about hashability in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immutable Types**: Simple immutable types (like `int`, `float`, `str`, and `frozenset`) are hashable. For example, once you create an integer in Python, its hash value will never change, making it possible to reliably use it as a key in a dictionary or as a member of a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Custom Objects**: By default, instances of user-defined classes are hashable because their hash value is their `id()` and they all compare not equal (except with themselves).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mutability**: If an object is mutable, like a list, it cannot be hashable. This is because if the object could be changed after it was added to a set or used as a key in a dictionary, it would be in the wrong hash bucket and could not be reliably found.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consistency**: For an object to be hashable, it must have a hash value that remains the same during its lifetime. This hash value is obtained using the `__hash__()` method. The object also needs to compare equal to other objects that have the same hash value using the `__eq__()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Custom `__hash__` Implementation**: If you define a custom `__eq__` method in a class, you must also define a custom `__hash__` method. It should return an integer and ideally take into account the same object attributes that are used for equality (`__eq__`). If `__eq__` is defined but `__hash__` is not, the instances of the class will not be hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, hashability in Python is a property of objects that are intended to be constant and used as the lookup key for sets and dictionaries."

However, the presence of the GIL has significant implications for multi-threaded Python programs:\n",

    "1. **CPU-Bound Tasks**: For CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation and would benefit from parallel execution across multiple CPU cores, the GIL is a bottleneck. Even though these tasks can be executed in a multi-threaded manner, the GIL ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. As a result, such tasks do not see a performance improvement from threading and might even perform worse due to the overhead of context switching between threads.\n",

While one thread waits for an I/O operation to complete, other threads can continue executing Python bytecode. Thus, multi-threading can improve the performance of I/O-bound applications by allowing them to handle other tasks while waiting for I/O operations."
