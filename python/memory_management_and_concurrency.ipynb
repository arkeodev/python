    "Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python memory manager. The process involves a combination of techniques including garbage collection, reference counting, and a private heap space for managing objects and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Private Heap Space**: Python memory management is centered around a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The allocation of this heap is managed by the Python memory manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reference Counting**: Python internally keeps track of the number of references to an object in the system. When an objectâ€™s reference count drops to zero, Python automatically reclaims the memory it occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Garbage Collection**: Python uses a garbage collector that periodically searches for groups of objects that are only accessible by each other, and therefore can be safely deleted. The garbage collector is based on the \"generation\" concept, where objects are categorized based on their longevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Pools**: Python employs a system of memory pools for managing small blocks of memory. When a Python object is destroyed, its memory block isn't immediately returned to the OS but is kept in a pool to be reused by future objects."
