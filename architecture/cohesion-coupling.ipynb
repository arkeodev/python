    "1. **Functional Cohesion**: When parts of a module are grouped because they all contribute to a single well-defined task.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A class `FileReader` that only reads data from a file and returns it as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sequential Cohesion**: When elements of a module are grouped because the output from one part is the input to another part.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A method that reads data from a file, processes it, and writes it to another file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Communicational Cohesion**: When parts of a module are grouped because they operate on the same data.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A class that handles all database operations for a specific entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Procedural Cohesion**: When elements of a module are grouped because they always follow a specific sequence of execution.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A function that validates input, processes the data, and then saves it to a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Temporal Cohesion**: When elements are grouped by when they are processed.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Initialization functions that need to be called at system startup.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Logical Cohesion**: When elements of a module are grouped because they are logically categorized to do the same thing even though they are different by nature.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A utility class that provides methods for logging, error handling, and configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Coincidental Cohesion**: When parts of a module are grouped arbitrarily. This is the weakest form of cohesion.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A utility class that has unrelated methods like parsing a file, sending emails, and generating random numbers."
